> Viken was a short-lived county in Norway that existed from 1 January 2020 to 1 January 2024. 
> Its name was derived from the historical region in modern Sweden. 
> The county was located in Eastern Norway when it was established on 1 January 2020 
> by the merger of [[Akershus]], [[Buskerud]] and [[Østfold]] 
> with the addition of the municipalities of Jevnaker, Lunner and the former Svelvik Municipality. 
> 
> Both its creation and its name—described as unhistorical by historians—
> were controversial from the onset, the merger was resisted by all the three counties 
> and the new county had an approval rating of about 20% in the region. Viken has been compared to gerrymandering. The newly constructed coat of arms of Viken lacked a historical basis and was described by experts as an amateurish logo that did not adhere to the rules of heraldry, and as "three flying saucers under a cap." The county executive of Viken determined in 2019, before the merger had taken effect, that the county's disestablishment was its main political goal, and the formal process to dissolve Viken was initiated by the county executive right after the 2021 Norwegian parliamentary election in which parties seeking to reverse the merger won a majority. The political platform of the government of Jonas Gahr Støre stated that the government would dissolve Viken and re-establish Akershus, Buskerud and Østfold based on a request from the county itself. On 22 February 2022, the regional assembly of Viken approved the formal request to disestablish the county, and the disestablishment took effect on 1 January 2024.
